## What Is an Application Programming Interface

The term API is an acronym, and it stands for “Application Programming Interface.”

Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to.

Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As” dialog box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.

This isn’t a perfect metaphor, as developers may have to provide their own data to the API to get the results, so perhaps it’s more like a fancy restaurant where you can provide some of your own ingredients the kitchen will work with.

But it’s broadly accurate. APIs allow developers to save time by taking advantage of a platform’s implementation to do the nitty-gritty work. This helps reduce the amount of code developers need to create, and also helps create more consistency across apps for the same platform. APIs can control access to hardware and software resources.

## What is a postman?

Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful API’s made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML request, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API’s functionality.

In using this postman app we need to understand about RESTful API. RESTful API / REST API is an implementation of API (Application Programming Interface). REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture of communication method that uses HTTP protocol for data exchange and this method is often applied in application development.

As can be seen above, the URL was added and sent. As a result, we got outputs similar to the second image.
